# Temporal-networks-by-spanning-trees

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a python program designed for the production of a spanning-tree method for constructing temporal networks. 

FILE
-----

Generate_static_underlying_topology.py: obtain a static underlying topology (static_adj_mat_origin.npy) and its spanning tree (static_adj_mat_tree.npy).

Bursty_activity_pattern.py: obtain a temporal network with a bursty activity pattern.

Poisson_like_activity_pattern.py: obtain a temporal network with a Poisson-like activity pattern.
